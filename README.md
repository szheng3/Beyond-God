# Beyond-God
Before you start, this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODetOE6cbbc) explains the parts that I find so hard to convey with my unduly narrative.

Humanity has never stopped creating deities, even in the era when we finally discovered the scientific method -- a sufficient and effective way to discern the wrong. The rest of those who didn't buy those theistic claims began having a good time ridiculing ideas that are deemed uncomprehensibly preposterous. In particular, they are thankful to the scientific advancement made in the past decades leading to the emergence of the irresistable and unavoidable entertainment device -- video game -- in which they can enjoy becoming and experiencing the imaginery god while eliminating the other gods. Well, mocking gods had never become more realistic than nowadays. 

This project allows you to experience being planetary designer. Hopefully, you can do better than the deities created thousands of years ago.
